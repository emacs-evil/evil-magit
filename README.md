Black magic
===========

This library configures Magit and Evil to play well with each
other.  Or rather that's what it is supposed to do eventually.

Users are encouraged to create a branch and show each other how
they have configured these two packages to play well with each
other.

I hope that eventually all the black magitians can collectively
come up with a configuration that works for most users, or that
we end up with a collection of reasonable configurations.

For a general discussion see https://github.com/magit/evil-magit/issues/1.

Branches
========

* `master` This is just a stub.  Eventually one of the other branches
  hopefully become the real `master`.
