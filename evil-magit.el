;;; Commentary:

;; This library configures Magit and Evil to play well with each
;; other.  Or rather that's what it is supposed to do eventually.

;; Users are encouraged to create a branch and show each other how
;; they have configured these two packages to play well with each
;; other.

;; I hope that eventually all the black magitians can collectively
;; come up with a configuration that works for most users, or that
;; we end up with a collection of reasonable configurations.

;; For a general discussion see
;; https://github.com/magit/evil-magit/issues/1.
